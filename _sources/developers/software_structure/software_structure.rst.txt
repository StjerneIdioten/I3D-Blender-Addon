Software Structure
==================

To get a general overview of the architecture of the exporter, I have cobbled together a customized version of a
UML Class Diagram. It implements a few custom conventions, to better fit in with the way the python code is structured.
This was not made specifically to communicate the architecture in an easy way to other people as much as it was created
for myself as a reference, when deciding on how to restructure the project in the best way possible. Thus you might
not agree with everything if you are "classically trained" in UML ;-) But in my opinion UML should be tailored to
whatever makes sense for you in a given situation.
